        <div class="topic">Let Medicaid Give You a Ride</div>
   
    <div class="intro">Medicaid covers the cost of emergency medical transportation for eligible individuals.
        An emergency is when your medical needs are immediate. Examples include having
        a heart attack or being seriously injured in a car accident. In cases like these, you may
        be taken to the emergency room by ground (ambulance) or air (medical flight). You
        do not need pre-approval for emergency transportation. If you need a ride to a medical
        appointment, Medicaid does not consider this an emergency, but you may still be able
        to get a ride.

    <div class="explain">
        Medicaid covers rides for eligible individuals to and from the doctor's office, the
        hospital, or another medical office for Medicaid-approved care. This coverage is
        called “non-emergency medical transportation,” because it does not involve a medical
        emergency. Medicaid may give you a ride if you do not have a car that works or do
        not have a driver's license. You may also be able to get a ride if you have a physical
        or mental disability or are unable to travel or wait for a ride alone. Coverage for these
        rides may be different depending on your individual situation and needs. You may need
        to get your State Medicaid agency's approval to qualify for a ride.
        </div>



   <div class="sub-topic">Who Can Get a Ride?</div>
   <div class="intro">
    Federal regulations say that Medicaid beneficiaries can get rides to and from providers
when necessary.[1] States have different rules about when rides are necessary, so make
sure you check with your State. Generally, when you enroll in Medicaid, you will
receive instructions about when a ride is necessary and how and when you can schedule
a ride. You may have to call a Medicaid caseworker, a ride service, or another agency.
<br>
That contact should:

    </div>

    <div class="points">
        • Help you decide if you have an immediate need for care;<br>
        • Make sure you are eligible for Medicaid;<br>
        • Verify that you have an appointment with a Medicaid provider;<br>
        • Make sure that you have no other reasonable way to make it to your
        appointment; and<br>
        • Decide what type of ride Medicaid can give you for your situation.
        <br>
        </div>
        <div class="intro">
            Based on this information, your contact will either set up the ride you need or will
            tell you how to set up the ride yourself. A person or ride service approved by the State
            Medicaid program will take you to and from your appointment.[2]<br>
            Generally, if you are enrolled in a Medicaid managed care plan, the customer service
            staff can give you facts about ride benefits.
