        <div class="topic">Total Safety</div>
   
    <div class="intro">Non-emergency medical transporters prioritize
         passenger safety at every stage, ensuring safe driving, proper
          vehicle entry and exit, and securing wheelchair and stretcher 
          passengers. Quality NEMTs employ qualified drivers and maintain
           up-to-date, technologically supported vehicles. Driver 
           qualifications and specific vehicle requirements are detailed 
           in a later section, underscoring the depth of commitment
         to safety in providing non-emergency medical transportation.

    <div class="topic">Timelessness, professionalism

        <div class="intro">Quality NEMTs excel in ride coordination,
             reducing wait times and ensuring punctual appointments. 
             Strategic route planning, direct partnership, and 
             cutting-edge software facilitate efficient pick-ups 
             and drop-offs. Accessible communication with route offices 
             and drivers is crucial. Punctual arrivals by uniformed drivers
              in marked vehicles further enhance the overall quality 
            of non-emergency medical transportation services.

    <div class="topic">Key considerations when
        selecting an Non Emergency Medical Trasnport .</div>
        <div class="sub-topic">HIGHLY TRAINED DRIVERS</div>

        <div class="intro">Your NEMT must have a team of trained drivers that can ensure your
            patients’ safety at all times. That starts with hiring the right people to serve
            as drivers, people who have a desire to serve with compassion and make a
            difference for your patients. At an absolute minimum, drivers should pass a
            thorough background check and provide:
            <div class="points">
            • A valid driver’s license(s) <br>
            • Successful completion of a DOT physical exam <br>
            • An up-to-date Motor Vehicle Check <br>
            • Documented experience assisting the elderly
            and those with disabilities <br>
            • Passed testing for alcohol and substance abuse <br>
        </div>
            A quality NEMT provider goes far above and beyond the bare minimum
            in training drivers. To serve the elderly, passengers with severe health
            conditions or those with mental and physical disabilities, drivers should
            receive population-specific training. Just as important, they should
            have a strong base of knowledge about emergency preparation, First
            Aid, defensive driving and vehicle care. For example, at Northwestern  Medical
            Transporters, we provide 14 courses for our drivers, or as we call them,
            Field Service Representatives, because they do much more than drive.
            When it comes to your patients’ safety and experience, you want a
            trusted partner and qualified, professional drivers. No amount of training
            is too much.

    <div class="sub-topic"> SAFE AND COMFORTABLE VEHICLES</div>
    <div class="intro">Don’t overspend on ambulance rides when an NEMT ride is available.
        Professional-quality NEMTs using the right vehicles can more cost-
        effectively handle the vast majority of non-emergency rides.
        The best NEMT providers have a full fleet of vans in a variety of sizes to
        cost-effectively handle any type of non-emergency need and serve any
        volume of rides. That includes wheelchair and ambulatory vehicles outfitted
        with cameras to monitor rides as well as GPS and security technologies to
        track exactly who’s driving, where they’re going and even their speed.
        Wheelchair vehicles should be equipped with wheelchair lifts and a four-
        point locking system to secure passengers. They should also have enough
        door width, headroom and space to safely accommodate all passengers
        NEMT vehicles should come fully outfitted with safety equipment,
        navigational technology, First Aid kits and backup equipment as well as
        complete insurance documentation. They should meet ADA standards and
        be inspected, insured, registered and up to date.
        </div>


        <div class="sub-topic"> TECHNOLOGY</div>
        <div class="intro">Today, more than ever before, technology has transformed NEMT services
            and the way they’re delivered. Modern NEMT providers should use a range
            of available technologies to guarantee security and ensure timeliness.
            One technology is the use of GPS tracking combined with a central
            software dashboard that shows the locations of company vehicles at all
            times. Software systems are available that provide a log of all trips and any
            events during a trip. For security, vehicles can now be designed to start
            only when professional company drivers use individualized key fobs that
            identify who’s driving. Each NEMT van should come equipped with cameras
            to monitor the ride, and every driver should be outfitted with technology
            that allows for instant communication with both the home office and care
            providers. At NWMT Medical Transport, we take this a step further,
            using a custom system that records all calls and interactions so nothing
            ever gets lost in translation.
            To ensure all of these technologies are always available, your NEMT should
            invest in Internet redundancy and cloud storage for continuous uptime. All
            of these technologies are not only available but are a requirement to deliver
            safe, efficient, cost-effective NEMT service for your patients.

        <div class="topic">Compassionate services</div>
        <div class="intro">Perhaps the most important element of quality NEMT service is
            compassionate help for passengers. Here are some examples of what that
            looks like in practice:
            
            <div class="points">
                • Helping wheelchair passengers navigate steps, pushing
                them in the wheelchair, securing them on the van<br>
                • Providing an arm to lean on for the elderly<br>
                • Walking passengers all the way to and from the door —
                going beyond just helping them on and off the vehicle<br>
                • Helping bed-bound passengers safely in and out of
                stretchers and onto and off of the van<br>
                • Making sure passengers are comfortable at all times<br>
                 
        </div>
        Exceptional drivers go above and beyond. Specifically, they’re trained in
serving those who require specialty accommodations and can relate well to
passengers. In many cases, drivers will regularly transport specific patients
to and from appointments over an extended period of time, even years.
It’s important for drivers to be able to form relationships with passengers
based on trust. That happens when drivers treat every passenger with
respect and dignity and take real pride in the work. This intangible element
has to be built into the culture of an NEMT and be fostered through both
hiring the right drivers and training them well.

    <div class="topic">Customizable, flexible programs</div>
    <div class="intro">Perhaps the most important element of quality NEMT service is
        compassionate help for passengers. Here are some examples of what that
        looks like in practice:</div>

        <div class="sub-topic"> PART I: BASICS OF NEMT SERVICES</div>
        <div class="intro">For starters, that means working with you on custom billing arrangements
            that fit your existing systems. Quality providers also offer the availability to
            schedule and plan rides on weekends, in the evenings and at odd discharge
            times, such as just before midnight or in the early morning.
            A true partner will sometimes even allow family members to ride with
            patients at no extra cost — important because family members will typically
            ride along with patients on about 20-30 percent of rides
            </div>


    <div class="topic">Long distance transportation</div>
    <div class="intro">We will take passengers on long-distance rides in the
        right circumstances. The cost is higher than other modes of transport, but
        in some cases, it’s the best option.
        
        </div>



        
        <div class="sub-topic"> RISK REDUCTION</div>
        <div class="intro">NWMT reduce the risk of harm coming to your patients as they go to and
            from appointments and care. They also reduce your risk. A quality NWMT
            carries full insurance on all vehicles and has all personnel professionally
            licensed and insured, eliminating headaches for you.
